Notes to Serwan:

get_reference() with argument, might want to return error if argument doesn't exist?

given a reference string, how do we access the component in QuAM?

properties visible in state.json?

Non-local components, e.g. network settings

Loading using base quam, i.e. by automatically detecting and importing relevant QuAM root module

Manually setting channel names 

Using Literal in components seems to fail type checking
